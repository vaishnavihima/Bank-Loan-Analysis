# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial decisions.
#🏦 Bank Loan Analysis – Finance Domain Project

##I’m excited to share my Power BI-based analysis of bank loan applications, completed as part of Resume Project Challenge 13. This project focuses on deriving actionable insights from financial data to support data-driven lending decisions.

#🎯 Project Objective:
Analyze loan application data to understand patterns in loan approvals, customer demographics, credit history, income profiles, and property areas, with the goal of reducing defaults and improving approval strategies.

##Key Observations:
Married applicants have a slightly higher loan approval rate than single applicants.
Applicants with a positive credit history are far more likely to have their loans approved.
Semi-urban applicants receive more loan approvals compared to urban and rural applicants.
Higher applicant income correlates with a higher likelihood of loan approval.
Moderate loan amounts are more frequently approved, while very high requested loans face more rejections.
Graduates show slightly higher approval rates than non-graduates.

##Supporting Metrics:
Marital Status: Married → 80% approval, Single → 75% approval
Credit History: Positive (1) → 90% approval, Negative (0) → 20% approval
Property Area: Semi-Urban → 78% approval, Urban → 74%, Rural → 70%
Applicant Income: Avg. approved → 5400/month, Avg. rejected → 3200/month
Loan Amount: Avg. approved → 150K, Avg. rejected → 180K
Education: Graduate → 77% approval, Not Graduate → 73% approval

#📝 Recommendations:
Strengthen credit history verification to reduce defaults.
Apply location-based strategies to improve approvals in rural and urban areas.
Design customized loan products based on income, employment, and education profiles.
Monitor approvals using Power BI dashboards for continuous insights.
This project reinforced my understanding of financial data analysis, KPI tracking, and dashboard visualization.
